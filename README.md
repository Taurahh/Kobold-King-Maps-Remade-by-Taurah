# Kobold-King-Maps-Remade-by-Taurah
Remade maps for the PF2e Adventure, Crown of the Kobold King. Lighting and walls are all set up for you to use! I tried to be as true to the book as I could, but some artistic liberty was taken to add more interest to the maps. 
Some of these maps are VERY BIG, because I like to give more room for combat, etc. You can adjust the grid size as needed.
